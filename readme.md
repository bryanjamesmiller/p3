Problem Set 3 for CSCI E-15

###Live URL of my P3:
http://p3.bryanmiller.me/

###Description of the project:  
The two main .php files used for my project are found in:
p3/public/logic.php
p3/app/views/index.php

I am trying to work on a few other files as well that are blade.php files, but for the purposes 
of this assignment only the two files above (as well as the css file and the routes.php file) 
are the focus.

This is a latin paragraph and User generator to help developers have something to work with
as they are creating web pages and just want to have some basic structure and info to act
as placeholders.

###Demo information:  
Link to my Jing screencast:  

###A list of any plugins, libraries, packages or outside code used in the project:  
I used some Google Fonts, as well as an image that can be found at the below link.  This
